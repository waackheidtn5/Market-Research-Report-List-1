<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iron Ore Pelletizing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Pelletizers (Disk Granulators)</li><li>Rotary Drum Pelletizing Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Iron ore pelletizing equipment primarily includes disc pelletizers and rotary drum pelletizing equipment. Disc pelletizers, or disk granulators, utilize a rotating disc to agglomerate fine iron ore into spherical pellets, enhancing uniformity and quality. They offer precise control over pellet size, making them ideal for smaller production volumes. Rotary drum pelletizing equipment, on the other hand, uses a rotating drum to create pellets through a tumbling action, suitable for larger scale operations due to its high throughput capacity. Both types enhance iron ore processing efficiency.</p></p>
